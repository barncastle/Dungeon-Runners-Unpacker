# Dungeon Runners Unpacker

A tool for extracting assets from the Dungeon Runners game.

To use, either:

1. Place in the game directory, next to the `game.pkg` and `game.pki` files
2. Run with command line passing the game directory e.g. `DungenRunnersUnpacker.exe "D:\Games\DungeonRunners"`

Files will be extracted to a new folder called `dump` within the game directory.
